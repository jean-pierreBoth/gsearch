# GSearch: A Rust Genomic Search Program based on Various MinHash-like Metrics and HNSW for Microbial Genomes

![Alt!](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/gsearch/blob/master/GSearch-logo.jpg?raw=true)

gsearch is the new name of the crate archaea.  It stands for **genomic search**.  

This package (**currently in development**) compute MinHash-like signatures of  bacteria and archaea (or virus and fungi) genomes and stores the id of bacteria and MinHash-like signatures in a Hnsw structure for searching of new request genomes. A total of ~50,000 to ~60,000 lines of highly optimized Rust code were provided in this repo and several other crates/libraries develped for this repo, such as [kmerutils](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/kmerutils), [probminhash](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/probminhash), [hnswlib-rs](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/hnswlib-rs) and [annembed](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/annembed), see below for details. Some of the libraries are very popular and have been used about 10 thousand times, see [here](https://crates.io/crates/hnsw_rs).

This package is developped by Jean-Pierre Both [jpboth](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth) for the software part and [Jianshu Zhao](https://github.com/jianshu93) for the genomics part. We also created a mirror of this repo on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Jianshu_Zhao/gsearch) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/jianshuzhao/gsearch) (You need to log in first to see the content), just in case Github service is not available in some region.

## Key functions
## Sketching of genomes/tohnsw, to build hnsw graph database

The objective is to use the Jaccard index as an accurate proxy of mutation rate or Average Nucleitide Identity(ANI) or Average Amino Acide Identity (AAI) According to equation:
$$ANI=1+\frac{1}{k}log\frac{2*J}{1+J}$$

where J is Jaccard-like index (e.g. Jp from ProbMinHash or J from SuperMinHash, SetSketch or Densified MinHash, a class of locality sensitive hashing algorithms, suitable for nearest neighbor search,  see below) and k is k-mer size.
To achieve this we use sketching. We generate kmers along genome DNA or amino acid sequences and sketch the kmer distribution encountered (weighted or not) in a file, see [kmerutils](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/kmerutils). Then final sketch is stored in a Hnsw database See here [hnsw](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320) or here [hnsw](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8594636).

The sketching and HNSW graph database building is done by the subcommand ***tohnsw***.

The Jaccard index come in 2 flavours:  
    1. The probability Jaccard index that takes into account the Kmer multiplicity. It is defined by :
    $$J_{P(A,B)}=\sum_{d\in D} \frac{1}{\sum_{d'\in D} \max (\frac{\omega_{A}(d')}{\omega_{A}(d)},\frac{\omega_{B}(d')}{\omega_{B}(d)})}$$
    where $\omega_{A}(d)$ is the multiplicity of $d$ in A
    (see [Moulton-Jiang-arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04052)).
    In this case for J_p we use the probminhash algorithm as implemented in [probminhash](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/probminhash), or see original paper/implementation [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9185081). 
    2. The unweighted (simple) Jaccard index defined by :
        $$Jaccard(A,B)=\frac{A \cap B}{A \cup B}$$
        In this case for J we use the [SuperMinHash](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05698), [SetSketch](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2244-ertl.pdf) (based on the locality sensitivity in section 3.3 or joint maximum likelihood estimation in section 3.2, joint estimation) or densified MinHash based on [One Permutation Hashing with Optimal Densification](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shrivastava17a/shrivastava17a.pdf) method or [One Permutation Hashing with Faster Densification](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/mai20a/mai20a.pdf) method, also implemented in probminhash mentioned above.  
        The above mentioned choices for sketching can be specified in "gsearch tohnsw" subcommand via the --algo option (prob, super/super2, hll and optdens). We suggest using either ProbMinHash or Optimal Densification. For SuperMinhash, 2 implementations are available: super is for floating point type sketch while super2 is for integer type sketch. The later is much faster than the former. hll is for SetSketch, we name it hll because the SetSketch data structure can be seen as a similar implementation of HyperLogLog, but adding new algorithms for similarity estimation (e.g., Locality Sensitivity, LSH or Joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation, JMLE for Jaccard index) in additional to distinct element counting. Also becasuse we think HyperLogLog is a beautiful name, which describes the key steps of the implementation.  
    The estimated Jaccard-like index is used to build HNSW graph database, which is implemented in crate [hnswlib-rs](https://crates.io/crates/hnsw_rs).

The sketching of reference genomes and HNSW graph database building can take some time (less than 0.5 hours for ~65,000 bacterial genomes of GTDB for parameters giving a correct quality of sketching, or 2 to 3 hours for entire NCBI/RefSeq prokaryotic genomes. ~318K). Result is stored in 2 structures:

- A Hnsw structure storing rank of data processed and corresponding sketches.
- A Dictionary associating each rank to a fasta id and fasta filename.

The Hnsw structure is dumped *in hnswdump.hnsw.graph* and  *hnswdump.hnsw.data*
The Dictionary is dumped in a json file *seqdict.json*

## Adding genomes to existing/pre-built database
For adding new genomes to existing database, the ***add*** subcommand is being used. It will automatically load sketching files, graph files and also paremeters used for building the graph and then use the same parameters to add new genomes to exisiting database genomes.

## Request, search new genomes agains pre-built database

For requests  the subcommand ***request*** is being used. It reloads the dumped files, hnsw and seqdict related
takes a list of fasta files containing requests and for each fasta file dumps the asked number of nearest neighbours according to distance mentioned above. A tabular file will be saved to disk with 3 key columns: query genome path, database genome path (ranked by distance) and distance. The distance can be transformed into ANI or AAI according to the equation above. Check the scripts for analyzing output from request here: https://github.com/jianshu93/gsearch_analysis

## Ann
For UMAP-like algorithm to perform dimension reduction and then visuzlizing genome database, we run it after the tohnsw step (pre-built database) (see below useage ann section). See [annembed](https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/annembed) crate for details. Then the output of this step can be visualized, for example for the GTDB v207 we have the following plot. A new paper for the library and also this subcommand is in preparation.

### Building database. database is huge in size, users are welcome to download gtdb database here: (<https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/release207/207.0/genomic_files_reps/gtdb_genomes_reps_r207.tar.gz>) and here (<https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/release207/207.0/genomic_files_reps/gtdb_proteins_aa_reps_r207.tar.gz>) or go to NCBI/RefSeq to download all available prokaryotic genomes

### build database given genome file directory, fna.gz was expected. L for nt and .faa or .faa.gz for --aa. Limit for k is 32 (15 not work due to compression), for s is 65535 (u16) and for n is 255 (u8)

gsearch --pio 2000 --nbthreads 24 tohnsw -d db_dir_nt -s 12000 -k 16 --ef 1600 -n 128 --algo prob
gsearch --pio 2000 --nbthreads 24 tohnsw -d db_dir_aa -s 12000 -k 7 --ef 1600 -n 128 --aa --algo prob

### When there are new genomes  after comparing with the current database (GTDB v207, e.g. ANI < 95% with any genome after searcing, corresponding to >0.875 ProbMinHash distance), those genomes can be added to the database

### old .graph,.data and all .json files will be updated to the new one. Then the new one can be used for requesting as an updated database

gsearch --pio 100 --nbthreads 24 add -b ./k16_s12000_n128_ef1600_canonical -n db_dir_nt (new genomes directory) 

### or add at the amino acid level, in the parameters.json file you can check whether it is DNA or AA data via the "data_t" field
cd ./GTDB/prot
gsearch --pio 100 --nbthreads 24 add -b ./k7_s12000_n128_ef1600_gsearch -n db_dir_nt (new genomes directory in AA format predicted by prodigal/FragGeneScanRs)

### visuzlizing from the tohnsw step at amino acid level (AAI distance), output order of genome files are the same with with seqdict.json
cd ./GTDB/prot
gsearch ann -b ./k7_s12000_n128_ef1600_gsearch --stats --embed
```

## Output explanation

**gsearch.answers.txt** is the default output file in your current directory.  
 For each of your genome in the query_dir, there will be requested N nearest genomes found and sorted by distance (smallest to largest).  
  If one genome in the query does not exist in the output file, meaning at this level (nt or aa), there is no such nearest genomes in the database (or distant away from the best hit in the database), you may then go to amino acid level or universal gene level.

## Dependencies, features and Installation

### Features

- hnsw_rs relies on the crate simdeez to accelerate distance computation. On intel you can build hnsw_rs with the feature simdeez_f

- annembed relies on openblas so you must choose between  the features "annembed_openblas-static" , "annembed_openblas-system" or "annembed_intel-mkl". You may need to install gcc, gfortran and make.
This can be done using the **--features** option as explained below, or by modifying the features section in  Cargo.toml. In that case just fill in the default you want.
- kmerutils provides a feature "withzmq". This feature can be used to store compressed qualities on a server and run requests. It is not necessary in this crate.

## Install/compiling by yourself

### First install Rust tools

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### gsearch installation and compilation from Crates.io (Recommended)

- simple installation, with annembed enabled would be with intel-mkl

```bash
    cargo install gsearch --features="annembed_intel-mkl"
```

or with a system installed openblas:

```bash
cargo install gsearch --features="annembed_openblas-system"
```

- On MacOS, which requires dynamic library link (you have to install openblas first):
(note that openblas install lib path is different on M1 MACs).  
So you need to run:

```bash
    brew install openblas
    echo 'export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    echo 'export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile
    cargo install gsearch --features="annembed_openblas-system"
```

#### gsearch installation from the most recent version from github

- direct installation from github:
  
```bash
    cargo install gsearch --features="annembed_intel-mkl" --git https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/gsearch
```

- download and compilation
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jean-pierreBoth/gsearch
cd gsearch
#### build
cargo build --release --features="annembed_openblas-static"
cargo build --release --features="annembed_intel-mkl"
###on MacOS, which requires dynamic library link (install openblas first, see above):
cargo build --release --features="annembed_openblas-system"
```

#### Documentation generation

Html documentation can be generated by running (example for someone using the "annembed_openblas-system" feature):

```bash
cargo doc --features="annembed_openblas-system" --no-deps --open
```

### Then install FragGeneScanRs

```bash
cargo install --git https://gitlab.com/Jianshu_Zhao/fraggenescanrs
```

### Some hints in case of problem (including installing/compiling on ARM64 CPUs) are given [here](./installpb.md)

## Pre-built databases

We provide pre-built genome/proteome database graph file for bacteria/archaea, virus and fungi. Proteome database are based on genes for each genome, predicted by FragGeneScanRs (<https://gitlab.com/Jianshu_Zhao/fraggenescanrs>) for bacteria/archaea/virus and GeneMark-ES version 2 (<http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/license_download.cgi>) for fungi.  

- Bacteria/archaea genomes are the newest version of GTDB database (v207, 67,503genomes) (<https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org>), which defines a bacterial speces at 95% ANI. Note that GSearch can also run for even higher resolution species database such as 99% ANI.
- Bacteria/archaea genomes from NCBI/RefSeq until Jan. 2023 (~318,000 genomes)(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/prokaryotes/>), no clustering at a given ANI threshold.
- Virus data base are based on the JGI IMG/VR database newest version (<https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/IMG_VR/IMG_VR.home.html>), which also define a virus OTU (vOTU) at 95% ANI.  
- Fungi database are based on the entire RefSeq fungal genomes (retrived via the MycoCosm website), we dereplicated and define a fungal speices at 99.5% ANI.
- All four pre-built databases are available here:<http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/data/gsearch>

## To do list

1.C-MinHash, One Permutation Hashing with Circular Permutation (Li and Li 2022 ICML), the best MinHash in terms of accuracy, which has a significant improvement for RMSE than any other MinHash-like ones. Using a circular permutation for empty bins in the sketch vector generated from OPH, so that the empty bins can have hash values borrowed from other non-empty bins with some randomness, not just copy from the nearest non-empty bins as in the densified MinHash scheme. However, the circular permutation vector can be large for large D with a regular K (MinHash K) and it has to be circularly shifted K times and applied K times, which might consume a large amount of memory. For microbial genomes, with D often 10^7 or so and K 10^4 to 10^5 to have 99% ANI accuracy, the permutation vector is not a problem. 

2. UltraLogLog, Ertl 2023, a significant improvement over HyperLogLog for space/memory for cardinality estimation. We can use inclusion and exclusion rule to estimate Jaccard index after obtaining cardinality of two sets despite large variance. A simple but efficient new estimator of cardinality estimation, FGRA (Further Generalized Remaining Area) based on Tau-GRA (Wang and Pettie, 2023) can be used. But we can also map UltraLogLog to corresponding HyperLogLog to use maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for cardinality (slower), or joint maximum likelihood estimator (JMLE) for intersecion cardinality (then Jaccard index), which are slightly more accurate than FGRA and meet the Cramér-Rao lower bound. However, the Hyperloglog-like scheme is not under the locality sensitive hashing scheme and the RMSE is much larger than MinHash-like ones.
   
3. For extremely large genome databases, e.g. 10^9 or more genomes, the size of sketches and HNSW graph size increase linearly, which creates a challenge for memory to store/load such big files. However, it is possible/easy to sketch and build HNSW graph only for a small piece of the large genome database and create several small sketch files and HNSW graph files for searching. We can search those several small pieces one by one, then collect search results(nearest neighbors) and sorting them accoridng to the Jaccard distance. This is algorithmically equal (for both accuracy and running time) to sketching and building HNSW graph for the entire large database but requires only a small piece of memory. We will definitely implement the idea in the near future. For now, it easy to just mannually split the large database into small pieces, similar to the real-world industrial-level application of this idea for graph-based NNS library [here](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p461-fu.pdf)
